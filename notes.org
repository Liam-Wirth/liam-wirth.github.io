* Notes on me website
tech stack as it stands right now:
Astro
Tailwind
Typescript


I like the bento boxes look from the astro themes pages:
[[https://github.com/Ladvace/astro-bento-portfolio][[ Bento Box Type look]]

other inspiration (seen in the dailies note for today)
1. [[https://aakash-sharma.netlify.app/][Aakash]] I like the technologies page, but a bit too animated for me
2. [[https://www.aarondunphy.com/][Aaron]] Simplicity, but maybe too much
3. [[https://aashutosh.dev/work/][Aashutosh]] I like the github calendar
4. [[https://www.aayushkurup.dev/about][Aayush]] I REALLY REALLY REALLY like his "about me" page, top notch
5. https://www.medevs.xyz/

* Github Page:
I want to eventually add a card on my work/projects tab that shows my github activity and stuff, look at how this app does that and maybe work towards cloning
functionality?
